# huffman_compression_ruby
 Compress files using a Ruby based Huffman algorithm

## TODO

- Create binary tree data structure
  - Each node/leaf should have: id, frequency_value, left_parent, right_parent
  - method to transverse tree from top 
  - method to count nodes
  - method to count leafs
- Use binary tree to create huffman tree
- Create method to store header in compressed file with huffman info
- Create method to decompress file
